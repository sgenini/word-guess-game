Welcome to Guess That Fruit!

### Instructions
1. Use your keyboard to type a letter
2. If the letter is in the word, it will update to show where it appears in the word. 
3. If the letter is not in the word, you will lose a guess and it will appear in the "Wrong Guesses" section.
4. Keep guessing until you complete the word, or you run out of guesses.
5. Completed words will count as a win, whereas running out of guesses will count as a loss.
6. Good luck!
